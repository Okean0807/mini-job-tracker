# Pending (NOT applied) migrations

Files here are NOT part of the Supabase migration chain and are NOT applied by
Supabase Branching / `db push`.

- `20260930220000_p1_ai_rate_limit_rls.sql` — enables RLS on `public.ai_rate_limits`.
  Verified 2026-10-11 and re-verified 2026-10-12 (read-only catalog check, see docs/security/ai-rate-limits-rls-audit.md): NOT applied in production
  (`relrowsecurity = false`). Table privileges for anon/authenticated are revoked,
  so access is only via the SECURITY DEFINER function `consume_ai_rate_limit`.
  To apply: move back into `supabase/migrations/` with a new version newer than
  the latest applied remote version, after explicit approval.
